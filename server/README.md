# Automation Tool — Server

This folder contains a minimal Express.js API for the Automation Tool project.

Quick start

1. Change into the server folder:

    cd server

2. Install dependencies:

    npm install

3. Start in development mode (auto-restarts on change):

    npm run dev

4. Open http://localhost:4000/ (or the port set in `.env`) and the API root is at `/api`.

Notes

-   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to set environment variables.
-   This is a small scaffold — feel free to add routes, middleware, auth, or tests.
